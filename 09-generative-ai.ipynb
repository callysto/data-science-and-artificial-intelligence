    "\n",
    "Generative artificial intelligence includes tools that can create things like pictures, stories, essays, or music. It generates content based on things in training data sets that are mostly likely to appear near other things. For example, the phrase that starts `Fortnite is my favourite` would most likely be followed by the word `game`.\n",

    "These tools are continually improving, and we'll take a look at some of them that we can use without signing up or logging in. If you find a link or tool here that is no longer working, please email `contact@callysto.ca` to let us know."
