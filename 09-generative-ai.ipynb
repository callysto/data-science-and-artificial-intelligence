    "Generative artificial intelligence is a tool that can create things like pictures, stories, essays, or music. It generates content based on things in its training data set that are mostly likely to appear near other things. For example, the phrase that starts `Fortnite is my favourite` would most likely be followed by the word `game`.\n",

    "These tools are continually improving, and we'll take a look at some of them that we can use in a Jupyter notebook."
